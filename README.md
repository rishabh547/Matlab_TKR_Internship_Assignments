# Matlab_TKR-models
## Internship Role: Physical Body Simulations using MATLAB and SIMULINK.

### After Understanding Basic Concepts of SIMULINK & its Working follwing Model Simulations were made:

1) Simple Pendulum
2) Office Chair
3) Table Fan
4) An Inclined Plane

Final Project : The Project involves making a piston inclined at a suitable angle to throw a shagai such that it crosses the threshold area (of given fixed dimensions)
This project was based on the theme of the competiton ABU ROBOCONÂ  2019.
