# Matlab_TKR-models
## Internship Role: Physical Body Simulations using MATLAB and SIMULINK.

### After Understanding Basic Concepts of SIMULINK & its Working following Model Simulations were made:

* Simple Pendulum
* Office Chair
* Table Fan
* An Inclined Plane

## Final Project :
The Project involved making a piston inclined at a suitable angle to throw a shagai such that it crosses the threshold area (of given fixed dimensions)
This project was based on the theme of the competiton ABU ROBOCONÂ  2019.

## Imp Concepts/Steps invloved in it : 
* Used 6-DOF Joint To Make The Shagai land Properly from an Inclined Ramp .
* Also Changed Solver Configuration to Fixed-step and Solver:Ode3 For a smoother simulation.
* Made use of Spatial Contact forces , Rigid transforms, Cartesian and 6-DOF joints , Brick Solids to make this and imported a Shagai Step file.


## Final Body Simulation:
